# The mass of M31
## Evans

* _Rotation curve_: Corbelli et al. (2010) 8-37 kpc tilted ring analysis.
  There are some asymmetries in outer parts. They also do a disk/bulge
  decomposition. Compare to Seigar et al. (2008).
* _Mass estimators_: calibrating against numerical simulations (GIMIC).
  General form: `M = C * sum(v^2 R^alpha)`. ~80% of masses are within factor
  of 2 from simulated masses.
* _Anisotropy_: distribution of satellite galaxies is roughly isotropic
  from ensemble average over simulated halos.
* _Rogue satellites_: ~3% of satellites unbound.
* _Results on M31_: Watkins et al. (2010) 1.4 +/- 0.4 x 10^12.
* _Proceed with caution_: Deason et al. (2012) declining velocity dispersion
  profile (BHB stars).
