# v_T of M31
## van der Marel

* _Timing argument_: Radial expasion Hubble flow -> decoupled. Tidal torques
  can introduce angular momentum. Therefore the orbit _is not_ necessarily
  radial from this argument!
* _Numbers_: maximum 200 km/s = 55 uas/year (how fast human hair grows at the
  distance of the moon). ~1/100 pixels w/ HST over ~10 yr baseline.
* _PM measurement_: ~10000 M31 stars/field, ~200 BG galaxies.
* _Corrections_: peculiar motion of stars too.
* _Measured_: < 34 km/s (needed to correct for solar motion).
* _Canonical simulation_: merger @ 6.3 Gyr and M33 continues to orbit.
* _Merger_: full mixing takes ~10 Gyr.
