## The mass of M31
### Evans

* _Rotation curve_: Corbelli et al. (2010) 8-37 kpc tilted ring analysis.
  There are some asymmetries in outer parts. They also do a disk/bulge
  decomposition. Compare to Seigar et al. (2008).
* _Mass estimators_: calibrating against numerical simulations (GIMIC).
  General form: `M = C * sum(v^2 R^alpha)`. ~80% of masses are within factor
  of 2 from simulated masses.
* _Anisotropy_: distribution of satellite galaxies is roughly isotropic
  from ensemble average over simulated halos.
* _Rogue satellites_: ~3% of satellites unbound.
* _Results on M31_: Watkins et al. (2010) 1.4 +/- 0.4 x 10^12.
* _Proceed with caution_: Deason et al. (2012) declining velocity dispersion
  profile (BHB stars).

## Proper motion of M31
### van der Marel

* _Timing argument_: Radial expasion Hubble flow -> decoupled. Tidal torques
  can introduce angular momentum. Therefore the orbit _is not_ necessarily
  radial from this argument!
* _Numbers_: maximum 200 km/s = 55 uas/year (how fast human hair grows at the
  distance of the moon). ~1/100 pixels w/ HST over ~10 yr baseline.
* _PM measurement_: ~10000 M31 stars/field, ~200 BG galaxies.
* _Corrections_: peculiar motion of stars too.
* _Measured_: < 34 km/s (needed to correct for solar motion).
* _Canonical simulation_: merger @ 6.3 Gyr and M33 continues to orbit.
* _Merger_: full mixing takes ~10 Gyr.

## PHAT
### Dalcanton

* HST survey in 6 filters across NE half of disk. Less extincted/contaminated
  half.
* There has been a public data release.
* ~90M stars so far. Measured up to 17 times.
* Confusion limited. Very significant in NIR/optical.

## The Stratoscope Project
### Savage

* Holy analog feedback loops for image stabilization in balloons, Batman!

## Stellar Dynamics in M31 Nucleus
### Magorrian

* 3D massless disk ala Peiris & Tremaine. Assumed DF with "clumps" in a/e(?)
  space? Optimizing _hundreds_ of parameters.
* 2D massless disk modeling is _hard_.

## The M31 Supermassive Black Hole
### Garcia

* `M31*` vs. `SgrA*` â€” further but much more massive (factor of ~100 each).
* Chandra monitoring of central M31 -> decade long lightcurve.
* Bright burst around 2006 brighter now w/ flares.

## Herschel Studies of the Interstellar Medium of M31
### Sandstrom

* Why M31 for ISM? Can study all scales and resolve stars.
* Full survey of M31 using Herschel. Coincidence with PHAT using SED fits
  to have details about stars/dust extinction.
* + spectroscopic survey from Herschel. (+ Spitzer, etc.)
* Full coverage of ISM phases!
* Pixel-by-pixel SED fitting (Aniano) -> dust map. _whoa_
* _Note to everyone_: use `histtype='step'` in `pyplot.hist`!
